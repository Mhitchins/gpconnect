## Consumer suppliers ##

Once your consumer product has been assured it will be added to the NHSD Service Catalogue, and you will be able to work with an NHS organisation to deploy and enable your GP Connect consumer system:

- become a [First of Type](overview_first_of_type.html) deployment

## Provider suppliers ##

When you have successfully validated your implementation of the GP Connect API, the GP Connect Provider Assurance team will award you a First of Type Development Milestone Achievement Certificate (DevMac) and (following integration testing) approval to go live. 

Your system will then enter a period of testing with a consumer supplier system (First of Type pilot). If this is achieved, full roll-out approval will be given and roll-out can begin in Live.
