You are a GP clinical system supplier or are working with the NHS to become one. You want to use GP Connect to enable other systems to access GP data on your system for *direct patient care*. Provider suppliers (such as EMIS Health, INPS Vision, Microtest Health and TPP) can use GP Connect to develop APIs that allow consumer applications to access data on their systems.
