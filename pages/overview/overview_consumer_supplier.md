GP Connect aims to support better clinical care by opening up information and data held within GP practice IT systems for use across health and social care.

As a consumer supplier, you want to use GP Connect to develop an API to consume GP data. You intend to work with a suitable end-user organisation, which you may or may not have already identified.

To get started:

- read about the GP Connect [priority capabilities](overview_priority_capabilities.html).
- look through the design decisions made so far in relation to each capability pack ([Foundations](foundations_design.html), [Access Record HTML](accessrecord.html), [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_structured_design.html) and [Appointment Management](appointments_design.html) and get involved:
	- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> / <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> A decision has been made for first release.
	- <span class="label label-warning">ASSUMPTION</span> An assumption has been made which is under review/needs validated.

Our developer ecosystem takes you through each stage of a typical GP Connect API project:
