**Under Construction**

Intro paragraph

## Getting started ##

## Explore ##
Use the system demonstrator to explore GP Connect functionality and access the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) and the Spine Directory Service (SDS) without an HSCN connection.

## Develop ##
There a number of APIs (capabilities) that GP Connect is aiming to deliver with the 4 GP Principal Clinical Systems Supplier– these relate to accessing GP records, appointments and structured data.
These need to be built to NHS standards – we are currently using FHIR standards

## Test and assure ##
The Consumer APIs need to go through a set of testing and assurance processes to ensure they are robust enough to meet the demands of busy NHS organisations. You will need to provide evidence that all tests have been completed.

## Deploy ##
Once your Consumer product has been assured it will be added to the NHSD Service Catalogue and you will be able to work with an NHS organisation to deliver the GP Connect API

Our developer ecosystem takes you through each stage of a typical GP Connect API project:
