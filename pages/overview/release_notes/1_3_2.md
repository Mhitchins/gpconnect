#### Updates to API

**Tickets:**&nbsp; [#848](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpconnect/issues/848)

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider and Consumer systems

**Description:**

- corrected an issue with the error handling for 'consultationSearchPeriod' - "The end date of the `consultationSearchPeriod` part parameter is greater than the start date" has been corrected to "The start date of the `consultationSearchPeriod` part parameter is greater than the end date"
- in the example the value for 'includeNumberOfMostRecent' has been corrected to use an 'integer' and not a 'string'
- updated 'includeNumberOfMostRecent' to use the 'positiveInt' datatype instead of an 'integer'
- added error condition for a part parameter with no value
- clarification stating that it is valid to include an empty Parameters.parameter in the case where it has only specified with optional part parameters
- A set of rules have been added around combinations of parameters that consumers **MUST NOT** use due to potential clinical issues.
- An error condition has been added for when a consumer has included a combination of parameters that isn't permitted
