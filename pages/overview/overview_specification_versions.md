## Specification Versioning ##

### Historical versioning model ###

Versioning of the GP Connect specificationhas been historically done using a seperate version for each area of the specification, the cross funtional requiremnet have one version and each of the different capability packs, such as Appointment Mangement and Access Record HTML, have their own versions.

The spec has been in a rapid development cycle with lots of change and updates based on analysis of requirements and feedback. Throughout this rapid development cycle the analysis and validating has focused on one capability packs at a time, moving onto the next area of the specification when the previous one has been updated and validated. When we move from FHIR DSTU2 to STU3 the process of working on one area of the spec at a time resulted in a breaking miss match between different areas of the spec, this lead to a re-evaluation of the way GP Connect does specification versioning.


### Current versioning model ###

Rather than versioning the different parts of the spec with different release versions, GP Connect has moved to a model where the whole spec will be versioned under a single version which respresents a snapshot of the spec at that point in time.

{% include note.html content="GP Connect have not yet done a release of the specification with a single overarching version. The release table below only contains the releases that have previously been done, and that we expect consumers and providers to build against." %}
