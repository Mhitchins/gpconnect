summary: Advice on choosing between JSON and XML

## Which serialisation format should I choose as an GP Connect API consumer - JSON or XML? ##

JSON is supported by all four GP principal clinical system (PCS) suppliers, which makes it a natural choice for API consumers. In addition, it is approximately 30% smaller than XML when sent over the wire.
 
XML is currently supported by three of the four principle suppliers (Vision, Microtest and EMIS). If you have a strong preference to work with XML and will be using GP Connect to interoperate with specific suppliers that support XML, then this may be a suitable choice.
 
NHS Digital is investigating ways to bring XML support across all four GP PCS suppliers. However, at the current time our recommendation is to use JSON.

For consumers with less experience working with JSON formats, [implementation tools in your language of choice](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/downloads.html) simplify the process of producing FHIR&reg; in JSON.
