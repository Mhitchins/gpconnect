## Purpose ##

The purpose of this page is to aid consumers by identifying the variances between provider response banner messages, and detail any business rules applied, where known. The messages provided are NOT requirements; they are for the information of consumers. Providers may change these messages over time.

It is extremely important for the details regarding the ending of a medication to be available to a clinician, as this will highlight any clinical issues (e.g. stopping a medication due to an allergy etc.) and allow the clinician to make an efficient and informed clinical decision. 

For the purpose of the specification the different circumstances of ending a medication are classified as: 

- naturally ended: medication naturally came to an end, i.e. no manual intervention via the user (auto system transition) 
- cancelled: actively stopped acute medication by user 
- discontinued: actively stopped repeat medication by user 

Available details for Cancelled and Discontinued (ideally including date and reason) **MUST** be provided in the Details column in the applicable subsections.

It is not currently possible for all GP system suppliers to distinguish between discontinued or cancelled and/or provide full details of the date and reason. Details of provider variance can be found here:
