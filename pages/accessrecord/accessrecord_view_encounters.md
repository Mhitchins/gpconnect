## Clinical narrative ##

An encounter is an interaction between a patient and a health care professional (HCP) that is recorded on the patient record. This can include:

- planned encounters - such as pre-arranged appointments with a GP
- unplanned encounters - such as at an out of hours clinic and those unrecorded through appointment module(s)
- direct encounters - such as a face-to-face session with a GP
- indirect encounters - such as a GP reviewing and updating a patient record on receipt of some test results


## Purpose ##

The purpose of supplying encounters within GP Connect is to allow a clinician to view a history of a patient's interactions with a clinician or an HCP.

## Sections and subsections ##

There is a single main section for encounters with no subsections.

## Section title ##

The section title **MUST** be 'Encounters'.

## Date filter ##

A date filter is applicable for the encounters section.

## Section content banner ##
