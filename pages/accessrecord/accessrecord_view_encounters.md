## Clinical narrative ##

An encounter is an interaction between a patient and a health care professional (HCP) that is recorded on the patient record. This can include:

- Planned encounters - such as pre-arranged Appointments with a GP
- Unplanned encounters - such as at an out of hours clinic and those unrecorded through appointment module(s)
- Direct encounters - such as a face-to-face session with a GP
- Indirect encounters - such as a GP reviewing and updating a patient record on receipt of some test results


## Purpose ##

The purpose of supplying encounters within GP Connect is to allow a clinician to view a history of a patientâ€™s interactions with a clinician or an HCP.

## Sections and subsections ##
