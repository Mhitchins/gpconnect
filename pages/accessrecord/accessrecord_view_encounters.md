## Clinical narrative ##

An encounter is an interaction between a patient and a health care professional (HCP) that is recorded on the patient record. This can include:

- planned encounters - such as pre-arranged Appointments with a GP
- unplanned encounters - such as at an out of hours clinic and those unrecorded through appointment module(s)
- direct encounters - such as a face-to-face session with a GP
- indirect encounters - such as a GP reviewing and updating a patient record on receipt of some test results


## Purpose ##
