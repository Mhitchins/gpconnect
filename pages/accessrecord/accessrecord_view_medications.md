## Additional medication information ##

### Ended medications ###

It is extremely important for the details regarding the ending of a medication to be available to a clinician, as this will highlight any clinical issues (for example, stopping a medication due to an allergy) and allow the clinician to make an efficient and informed clinical decision.

Any information relevant to the circumstances of ending a medication **SHALL** be provided in the `Additional Information` column. The following definitions are provided to support the labelling of the information within Additional Information:

- **Naturally ended**: Medication naturally came to an end, that is, no manual intervention via the user (auto system transition)
- **Cancelled**: Actively stopped acute medication by user
- **Discontinued**: Actively stopped repeat medication by user

For Cancelled and Discontinued the reason **SHALL** be included as human readable text where coded or free text information if captured as part of the cancellation or discontinuation action. The date **SHALL** also be included. The date **SHALL** be the date recorded as the date cancelled or discontinued if a user entered a date, or the transaction date if not.

For Naturally Ended medications the end date and reason **SHALL NOT** be included in additional information.

If a system provider cannot differentiate between naturally ended, discontinued and cancelled, or cannot provide clear details for cancelled and discontinued in the form of an accurate date, or clearly display reason text which will differentiate a clinical discontinuation (for example, stopping a medication due to an allergy), from any other reason for ending the medication (for example, change to an alternative, equivalent medication without clinical issues having occurred) a section/subsection banner message(s) as appropriate **SHALL** be included to describe the extent or limitation of compliance.

### Prescribed elsewhere ###

All subsections (except All Medication Issues) **SHALL** include items which are recorded on the system as a prescription but prescribed elsewhere (for example, hospitals or special clinics) or ‘Over The Counter’ drugs taken by the patient and recorded on the system as a prescription.

### GP2GP transfer ###

Repeat medications transferred as part of GP2GP **SHALL** only be included in the Current Repeat Medications subsection if authorised by a clinician at the new practice, otherwise they are treated as not current, therefore they appear in All Medication (Summary) and All Medication Issues, but not in Current Repeat Medication.
