### Discontinued/cancelled/naturally ended medications ###

{% include custominfocallout.html content="**Note:** It is not currently possible for all GP system suppliers to distinguish between “Discontinued”, “Cancelled” & “Naturally Ended” medications." type="info" %}

The definitions for each of these are supplied below:

- **Naturally ended:** Medication naturally came to an end, i.e. no manual intervention via the user (auto system transition)
- **Cancelled:** Actively stopped acute medication by user
- **Discontinued:** Actively stopped repeat medication by user

Not all suppliers can supply the details (date and reason) for the ending of a medication (either through discontinuation or cancellation).

It is extremely important for the details regarding the ending of a medication to be available to a clinician, as this will highlight any clinical issues (e.g. stopping a medication due to an allergy etc.) and allow the clinician to make an efficient and informed clinical decision.

Refer to decision log item (HDL-212) which contains significant detail around this issue.

The current behaviour of the suppliers is as follows:

<div class="panel-group" id="accordion4">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <div class="panel-heading">
                                <a class="noCrossRef accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion4" href="#collapseThirteen">EMIS behaviour  (click here to expand/collapse) </a>
						</div>
                        <div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse noCrossRef">
                            <div class="panel-body">
								<p>EMIS cannot distinguish between cancelled, discontinued or ended (always identified as expired for naturally ended), although they do hold a date and free text reason within their system.</p>
								<p>To reduce the clinical risk the following recommendations have been made:</p>	
									<ul>
										<li>The mitigating banner EMIS have implemented is used for pilots only.</li>
										<li>The mitigating banner is complemented by providing pilot users with additional guidance on the behaviour of past medications as part of a wider guidance document (again, pilots only).</li>
										<li>The cancellation/end reason field is included as part of future HTML view specification release, which providers must support as soon as possible (after initial pilots once further pilot feedback has been received). It should be noted the a strategic programme decision has been made to confine the next version of HTML View Access Record to only include resolutions for clinical issues.</li>
									</ul>
								<p>NOTE: EMIS cannot meet the original requirement of displaying discontinued date for discontinued and cancelled medications due to the way data is stored within EMIS Web. In light of this, the end date and reason suggested as a long term solution would also include the end date and reason for naturally ended medications.</p>

{% include customcallout.html content="**Warning:** The current medications list will only contain those items prescribed by the patient's current GP organization. Hence, if the patient has been issued prescriptions elsewhere or has recently moved GP practice then this list may not be complete. " type="danger" %} 


### Date filter ###

All relevant records **SHALL** be returned (i.e. no time limit/filtering is to be applied).

### Subsection business rules ###

The following business rules are applicable:

| Supplier | Business Rules |
|----------|----------------|
| EMIS | Medication item appears in this section if it has been 28 days or less for from the last issued date (applies to acute and repeat medications) |
| TPP | TBC |
| INPS | Medication item appears in this section if it has been 12 months or less for from the last issued date (applies to acute and repeat medications) |
| MicroTest | Microtest use two ‘lists’ to present the patient drugs to the user who can then toggle between the two as they choose. The lists are headed ‘current’ and ‘removed’ and aim to break a potentially long list of drugs into two more relevant groups.<br><br>‘Current Medication Issues’ are repeat and acute medications in the patient’s ‘current’ list, the ‘Current Repeat Medications’ are repeat medications in the patient’s ‘current’ list and the ‘Past Medication’ are repeat and acute medications in the patient’s ‘removed’ list.<br><br> This categorisation is either set manually by the doctor, or is automatically moved after a configurable period – typically 6 months from the last issued date.|

### Table construction requirements ###

Providers must adhere to the table construction requirements listed below:

- Table header **SHALL** be "Current Medication Issues".
- Table columns **SHALL** be ordered left-to-right (1..N).
- Table content **SHALL NOT** be truncated.
- Table rows **SHALL** be ordered by date descending (i.e. most recent date/time first).

### Table columns ###

Providers must return all the columns as described in the table below:

| Order | Name | Description | Value Details &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| <center>1</center> | `Start Date` | Start date of medication item issued | `dd-Mmm-yyyy` |
| <center>2</center> | `Medication Item` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Descriptive name of medication item (inculding dosage) | `free-text` |
| <center>3</center> | `Type` | Type of medication issued (values `Repeat` or `Acute`) | `free-text` |
| <center>4</center> | `Scheduled End` | Scheduled end date of medication issued | `dd-Mmm-yyyy` |
| <center>5</center> | `Days Duration` | Duration of medication issued | `integer` |
| <center>6</center> | `Details` | Longer human readable free-text details for the medication item &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | `free-text` |

Provider systems **SHALL** include all relevant clinical content in the `Details` free-text field. As a minimum the free-text narrative **SHALL** include these items: <br>
- `MedicationOrder.medication.code`
- `MedicationOrder.dosageInstruction.dose[x]`
- `MedicationOrder.dosageInstruction.schedule[x]`
- `MedicationOrder.dosageInstruction.rate`
- `MedicationOrder.dosageInstruction.maxDosePerPeriod`

## Current repeat medications##

### Subsection business rules ###

The following business rules are applicable:

| MicroTest | Microtest use two ‘lists’ to present the patient drugs to the user who can then toggle between the two as they choose.

## Past medications ##

### Clinical narrative ###

A history view of drugs or other forms of medicines that have been used to treat or prevent disease for the patient.

Where the medication was cancelled (Acute) or Discontinued (Repeat), this should be included in the Details column as Cancelled followed by Date of Cancellation or Discontinued, followed by Date when discontinued.

### Date filter ###

A date filter is applicable for the Past Medications subsection:

- All relevant records **SHALL** be returned according to the consumer-supplied date range
- If a date is not supplied all records **SHALL** be returned
