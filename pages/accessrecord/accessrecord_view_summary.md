## Clinical narrative ##

Clinicians work in busy and time-pressured environments. They need access to high-quality, relevant and wherever possible consistent information to support safe, effective and efficient assessment of their patients.

Timely sharing of clinical information is key to the delivery and improvement of safe and effective clinical care.

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this section is to provide a summarised view of the pertinent clinical information regarding a patient within a single screen. This allows a clinician to efficiently peruse key information from the patientâ€™s clinical record and supports clinical decision making.

## Sections ##

There is only a single main section for the summary section with five subsections:

 - [Last 3 Encounters](accessrecord_view_summary.html#last-3-encounters)
 - [Active Problems and Issues](accessrecord_view_summary.html#active-problems-and-issues)
 - [Current Allergies and Adverse Reactions](accessrecord_view_summary.html#current-allergies-and-adverse-reactions)
 - [Recent Acute Medication](accessrecord_view_summary.html#current-medication-issues)
 - [Current Repeat Medications](accessrecord_view_summary.html#current-repeat-medications)
