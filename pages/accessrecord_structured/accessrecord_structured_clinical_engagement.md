## Clinical engagement ##

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support a wide range of clinical uses, GP Connect has engaged with a range of clinicians and other stakeholders to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support its use.

This engagement has included:

 - Hospital consultants and doctors
 - Hospital pharmacists and technicians
 - Mental health nurses
 - Mental health pharmacists and technicians
 - Mental health point of access centre
 - General practitioners
 - Community pharmacists
 - Midwives
 - Health visitors
 - Health system suppliers
 - Commissioning support units
 - Hospital trusts

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business use cases, user stories and the logical data model. These will form the basis of the technical specification and will be used to assure that the GP Connect API meets the needs of the business.
