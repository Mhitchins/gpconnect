## Degraded medications and medical devices

Where degraded medication/medical device records arising from GP2GP record transfer or any other means are present in the patient record then these **MUST** be coded using the appropriate degrade code (`196421000000109`, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the original medication/medical device name conveyed by `CodeableConcept.text`.

## Medication and Medical Device interoperability

Consumers of medication/medical device resources generated by other systems **MUST** consider the clinical safety issues arising from processing medication/medical device information recorded in different care settings and contexts, and seek clinical safety guidance where appropriate. 

Key concerns are the understandability of received medication/medical device information and appropriate actions to degrade and identify medication/medical device concepts which are not understood by the receiving system. Appropriate clinical workflows may also be required at the receiver - for example, deactivation of received medications/medical devices such that they **MUST** be explicitly re-authorised to make them issuable.

Currently dosage and quantity information are expressed in unstructured/textual form. A system intending to consume dosage and quantity information needs to be capable of handling unstructured quantities and dosages.

## Mixtures 

In some systems it is possible to prescribe custom formulations compounded from other medications (extemporaneous preparations). Mixtures **MUST** be expressed using the degrade code (`196421000000109`, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the constituents of the mixture expressed via `CodeableConcept.text`.

## dm+d name versus displayed name

It is possible for historic/legacy medications/medical devices to be displayed with a name corresponding to the name in the original system’s drug dictionary rather than the dm+d name. This name **MUST** be preserved via `CodeableConcept.text` when representing the medication via resources. `CodeableConcept.text` is redundant when the displayed medication/medical device name on the original system and the dm+d name is identical, and, in these cases, `CodeableConcept.text` **MUST** be omitted.

## Medication reviews

The resources required to describe diarised review activities and reminders for medication reviews are out of scope for this guidance. 

## Future-dated prescriptions

Medication/Medical Device issues may be future-dated – for example, repeat dispensed medications or a deferred acute medication that may not be needed if the condition resolves.

## Amendments

Where an authorisation is amended – for example, Proprietary/Generic switch, altered dates, change of quantities and so on, then the existing authorisation/plan **SHOULD** be stopped or discontinued, and an appropriate reason supplied via `statusReason.reason`. A new authorisation **SHOULD** be created, in the form of a `MedicationStatement` and `MedicationRequest` with `intent` of `plan`, to hold the amended details. Subsequent issues of the medication **SHOULD** reference the amended authorisation rather than the previous version.

## Medication discontinuation/stopping ###

Where a medication/medical device is stopped or discontinued then the status of the authorisation **MUST** be changed to 'stopped' and a textual stop reason provided via `statusReason.reason`.

A `statusReason` **MUST NOT** be generated when an authorisation has simply expired (exceeded review date or number of issues).

## Authorisation 

In conjunction with `MedicationStatement`, a `MedicationRequest` with an `intent` of `plan` represents an authorisation for acute, repeat, repeat dispensed medication/medical device.

## Re-authorisation 

Where a medication/medical device is re-authorised a new authorisation **MUST** be generated in the form of a `MedicationStatement` and `MedicationRequest` with `intent` of `plan`. Subsequent issues of the medication/medical device **MUST** reference the new authorisation.
