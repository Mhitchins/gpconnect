## Guidance

### Degraded medications
Where degraded medication records arising from GP2GP record transfer are present in the patient record then these should be coded using the appropriate degrade code (196421000000109, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the original medication name conveyed by CodeableConcept/text.

### Medication interoperability
Consumers of medication resources generated by other systems should consider the clinical safety issues arising from processing medication information recorded in different care settings and contexts and seek clinical safety guidance where appropriate. 

Key concerns are the understand-ability of received medication information and appropriate actions to degrade and identify medication concepts which are not understood by the receiving system. Appropriate clinical workflows may also be required at the receiver e.g. deactivation of received medications such that they must be explicitly re-authorised to make them issueable.

Currently dosage and quantity information are expressed in unstructured/textual form. A system intending to consume dosage and quantity information needs to be capable of handling unstructured quantities and dosages.

### Mixtures
On some systems it is possible to prescribe custom formulations compounded from a number of other medications (extemporaneous preparations). Mixtures should be expressed using the degrade code (196421000000109, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the consituents of the mixture expressed via CodeableConcept/text.

### Non dm+d medications
In some cases drugs may be recorded as freetext or may be present in the original systems drug dictionary but not in dm+d. Where no dm+d code is available to describe the medication then the medication code should be expressed using the degrade (196421000000109, Transfer-degraded medication entry) with the original drug name present in CodeableConcept/text. 

### dm+d name versus displayed name
It is possible for historic/legacy medications to be displayed with a name corresponding to the name in the original systems drug dictionary rather than the dm+d name. This name should be preserved via CodeableConcept/text when representing the medication via resources. CodeableConcept/text is rendundant when the displayed medication name on the original system and the dm+d name are identical and in these cases CodeableConcept/text should be omitted.

### Medication reviews
The resources required to describe diarised review activities and reminders for medication reviews are out of scope for this guidance. 

### Future dated prescriptions
Medication issues may be future dated e.g. repeat dispensed medications or a deferred acute medication that may not be needed if the condition resolves.

### Amendments 
Where an authorisation is amended e.g. Proprietary/Generic switch, altered dates, change of quantities etc. then the existing authorisation/plan should be stopped/discontinued and an appropriate reason supplied via detectedIssue. A new authorisation should be created, in the form of a MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest with intent='plan', to hold the amended details and subsequent issues of the medication should reference the amended authorisation rather than the previous version.

### Medication discontinuation/stopping
Where a medication is stopped/discomtinued then the status of the authorisation should be changed to 'stopped' and a textual stop reason provided via detectedIssue/detail.

A detectedIssue should not be generated when an authorisation has simply expired (exceeded review date or number of issues)

### Authorisation

In conjunction with MedicationStattement, a MedicationRequest with an intent of 'plan' represents an authorisation for acute, repeat, repeat dispensed medication

### Re-authorisation
Where a medication is re-authorised a new authorisation should be generated in the form of a MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest with intent='plan' and subsequent issues of the medication should reference the new authorisation.
