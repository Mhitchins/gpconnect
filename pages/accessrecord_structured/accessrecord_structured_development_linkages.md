## Linkages ##
The purpose in developing the FHIR profiles is to ensure that clinical data is, as much as possible, presented the same way regardless of the provider system. This ensures the consuming system (and clinician) will always know where to look for each type of information.


However, information about the patient is not just held within the profiles but in how those profiles are linked together. 


For example, linking a medication to a problem means that as well as the record showing the what the patient is taking, it also explains why they are taking it.


For a consuming system to be able to interpret this linkage information correct it needs to be presented in the same way regardless of the providing system.

### GP Connect FHIR Model ###
To support this, GP Connect has developed a FHIR model that identifies all the GP Connect FHIR profiles and how they are related together to store the patient record.


The model currently covers consultations, problems, medications, allergies, immunisations and uncategorised data. Other clinical areas will be added as they are developed.

The relationships between two FHIR resources are defined in only one of the linked FHIR resources (similar to in a RDBMS). This is shown by the direction of the arrow in the FHIR model. 


For example, the MedicationStatement resource contains a field that can be used to lookup the linked medication. There is no field in the Medication resource that can be used to lookup the linked MedicationStatement.

## FHIR Profiles Returned on Query ##
There are three main considerations when determining which data is returned by a query on each clinical area.
* Include all the FHIR profiles required to fully describe the requested clinical area
* Include the FHIR profiles required to describe linkages from the requested clinical area
* Include the FHIR profiles from linked clinical areas where they are key to understanding the requested clinical area. 

### Consultations ###
When returning a consultation record include the follow:
* The Encounter profile of the Consultation
*	The List profiles of the Consultation
*	The ProblemHeader profile of any directly linked Problems
*	The MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement and Medication profiles of any linked Medications or Medical Devices.
    * Always include the MedicationStatement, MedicationRequest (intent = plan) and Medication profiles.
    * Only include MedicationRequest (intent = order) for directly linked issues.
*	The AllergyIntolerance profile of any linked Allergies
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Allergies
*	The Immunization profile of any linked Immunisations
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Immunisations
*	The Observation profile of any linked Uncategorised Data
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Uncategorised Data

### Problems ###
When returning a Problem record include the follow:
*	The ProblemHeader profile of the Problem
*	The ProblemHeader profiles of any directly linked Problems
*	The MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement and Medication profiles of any linked Medications or Medical Devices.
    *	Always include the MedicationStatement, MedicationRequest (intent = plan) and Medication profiles.
    *	Only include MedicationRequest (intent = order) for directly linked issues.
*	The AllergyIntolerance profile of any linked Allergies
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Allergies
*	The Immunization profile of any linked Immunisations
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Immunisations
*	The Observation profile of any linked Uncategorised Data
    *	Include the ProblemHeader profile of any Problems linked to the returned Uncategorised Data

### Medications and Medical Devices ###
When returning a Medication and Medical Device record include the follow:
*	The MedicationRequest (intent = plan), MedicationStatement and Medication profiles of the Medication and Medical Device
*	Where requested by the consumer system, the MedicationRequest (intent = order) profile for every issue.
*	The ProblemHeader profiles of any directly linked Problems

### Allergies ###
When returning an Allergy record include the follow:
*	The AllergyIntolerance profile of the Allergy
*	The ProblemHeader profiles of any directly linked Problems

### Immunisation ###
When returning an Immunisation record include the follow:
*	The Immunization profile of the Immunisation
*	The ProblemHeader profiles of any directly linked Problems

### Uncategorised Data ###
When returning an Uncategorised Data record include the follow:
*	The Observation profile of the Uncategorised Data
*	The ProblemHeader profiles of any directly linked Problems
