## Use Case Name

View Patient centric summary in Leeds Care Record.

## Brief Description

Leeds Care Record (LCR) intends to deliver an integrated patient
summary, presented to every user, when they first log into a patient. In
order to do this they will require structured data from GP systems EMIS
and System One. (Hospital, Community, Mental health and Social care data
already comes in structured form)

## Scenarios

-   district nurse checking a patient’s record before visiting the
    patient at their home so they have an up to date understanding or
    their medical status and treatments from all the

-   Mental Health professional, reviewing a patient’s holistic situation
    as part of initial assessment - understanding the various encounters
    the patient is receiving across all care settings

-   hospital pharmacist assessing medications and allergies across all
    care settings as part of meds reconciliation process

## Use Case Justification

Structured GP data is an essential element for Leeds Care Record.

This is due to extensive feedback we have received that frontline users
find the current layout too complex to navigate and they require a
snapshot view of the patient across all care settings

This patient summary could be re-used in other locations once delivered

## Primary Actors

- Any clinician/care giver who views the Leeds Summary Record and are not a hospital user (hospital users will receive their own patient summary with a hospital focussed scope). Approximately 2100 users currently fit this category.

## Secondary Actors

*{A secondary actor is a person or group of people that is needed to
complete the process successfully.}*

## Triggers

- Non-hospital user accesses patient’s Leeds Care Record view of their patient to gain a snapshot of who is involved with the patient, what alerts, allergies, medications etc. are currently available.

## Pre-Conditions

-   patient must be registered at a Leeds Care Record GP Practice

-   patient must have a valid NHS number

-   patient must have data sharing preferences in their GP Practice
    Clinical System set to allow the sharing of data

## Post Conditions

*{Post-conditions are guaranteed outcomes of the use case. Any
post-condition is guaranteed to the true when the use case ends.}*

-   **On Success:**

    Patient data will be retrieved from the patient’s GP Practice
    Clinical System and incorporated into the summary screen displayed
    to the user.

-   **Guaranteed:**

	Either the patient’s data, or an error message explaining why there is
	no data passed will be available to display in the patient summary
	screen

## Potential Error messages

-   No data available

-   Patient not found

-   Sharing Agreement is not set up

-   Patient does not consent

-   Response payload is invoked

-   Unable to invoke endpoint

-   Unable to resolve NACS

-   Unknown error details

-   Timeout

-   Message processing error

-   Request channel timeout

-   Underlying connection was closed

-   No endpoint listening
