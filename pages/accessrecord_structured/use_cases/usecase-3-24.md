summary: "Use case for practice nurse administering a vaccination"
---

## Brief description

A practice nurse may administer a range of vaccinations. The vaccination may be of a specific type as part of a vaccination program for example, seasonal flu vaccination, or the vaccination may need to be determined according to discussion with the patient as to their specific circumstances - for example, travel vaccination. Most vaccinations will be administered to patients registered to the practice, but some circumstances may arise through hubs and specialist services (for example,  Yellow Fever vaccination). There are certain checks which need to be performed to ensure the vaccination they are giving is safe and appropriate for the patient. These checks can be assisted through access to the patient record.

## Use case justification

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading to a reduction in prescribing errors
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems
  - reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently

Patient-focused:

  - security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based 'patient identifiable documents' in use within departments
  - increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient
  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the pharmacist

## Primary actors

  - practice nurse
  - GP Connect
  - GP clinical systems

## Secondary actors

  - patient
  - travel vaccination knowledge base

## Triggers

  - patient attends a GP practice for a vaccination

## Preconditions

  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the GP system upon attendance
  - the practice nurse has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect
  - the patient consents to this shared information being viewed/used by the practice nurse
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions

  - **On success:**
    
      - the patient's medical record is made available to the practice nurse

  - **Guaranteed:**
    
      - the practice nurse will treat the patient based on the information available
