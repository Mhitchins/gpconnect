## Brief description

A child, Sue, is brought to a vaccination appointment by her father Bill. Bill is registered at the practice, but Sue is registered elsewhere. Sue is registered at the same practice as her mother Lucy (Bill and Lucy are separated). Bill explains that Sue is living with him for the time being and that he has agreed with Lucy to bring Sue to his practice. Bill explains that this is a temporary arrangement whilst Lucy recovers from recent surgery and so does not want to change Sue's registered practice.

Joel (practice nurse) calls up the medical records for Sue. Joel needs to check the immunisation history to ensure that the vaccination has not previously been administered and that there are no other indicators that the vaccination is not applicable for Sue.

Lucy/Sue's registered practice is local to Joel/Bill's practice and they have a data sharing agreement and can access each other's records via GP Connect.

Lucy has previously refused this vaccination for Sue, but Bill has not declared this \[1\].

## Use case justification

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information

Patient-focused:

  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the practice nurse

## Primary actors

  - practice nurse
  - GP Connect
  - GP clinical systems

## Secondary actors

  - patient
  - patient's parents or guardians

## Triggers

  - child and parent attend appointment for a vaccination or attend a vaccination clinic

## Preconditions

  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the GP clinical system
  - the practice nurse has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect
  - the patient's parent consents to this shared information being viewed/used
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/GP clinical system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions

  - **On success**
    
      - the parent's wishes are fully adhered to and the vaccination is given or withheld appropriately

  - **Guaranteed**
    
      - the child is appropriately assessed for the vaccination and the vaccination is given or withheld appropriately based on available medical history

1.  “Although the consent of one person with parental responsibility for a child is usually sufficient (see Section 2(7) of the Children Act 1989), if one parent agrees to immunisation but the other disagrees, the immunisation should not be carried out unless both parents can agree to immunisation or there is a specific court approval that the immunisation is in the best interests of the child.” Source: [Green Book Chapter 2](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144250/Green-Book-Chapter-2-Consent-PDF-77K.pdf)
