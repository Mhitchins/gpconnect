summary: "Use case for 111/999 call handler"
---

**Brief description:**

A patient calls 111/999 and the call handling system is able to interrogate the GP system to search for information that the patient is end of life.

The flow of information will be from the GP system to the call handling system.

Data needs to be supplied using SNOMED CT codes.

This use case will take place every time a call takes place. The expected volume of this happening is to be determined.

Similar use cases could be developed to flag other key conditions that would impact how a call is handled such as the patient being diagnosed with Learning Difficulties, Diabetic, etc.

**Use case justification:**

If a call handler is aware that the caller is an end of life patient they will amend their response to the call ensuring that the patient gets the most appropriate outcome.

Currently, without this information, they have to go through the pathways modules and follow the dispositions which are produced.

**Primary actors:**

- 111/999 call handler
- call handling system

**Secondary actors:**

- patient

**Triggers:**

- the information is searched for automatically once the patient's ID has been established

**Pre-conditions:**

  - the patient's NHS number is available to the call handling system
  - the call handler has the relevant permissions to access the information
  - the call handling system is able to interact automatically with the GP system (or proxy)
  - the information is presented to the call handler early in the call
  - the patient has consented to share their data
  - end of life is recorded as one of a set of possible clinical codes in the patents medical record on the GP system
  - there is an agreed workflow for patients with an end of life status which the call handler is able to follow

**Post conditions:**

  - **On Success:**
    
      - the patient receives advice/treatment which is timely and the most appropriate for their needs

  - **Guaranteed:**

	- the patient receives advice/treatment which is safe
	- access is recorded for auditing purposes
	- information on which decisions are made is available for critical incident review / medico-legal investigation.

**Basic flow with alternative and exception flows:**

*{The basic flow is the best case scenario (meaning the happy path) of what should happen in the use case if all the conditions are met. Describe other allowed variations of the basic flow. Are the any alternate routes that can be taken? Describe Error Conditions or what happens when a failure occurs in the flow}*
