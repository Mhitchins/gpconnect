## Use Case Name

Medicines Reconciliation for Acute Care Admissions.

## Brief Description

Upon admission to or attendance at hospital, the attending clinician is
responsible for consolidating a list of the patient’s medications.
Information on medications listed within the GP System (SCR) is
gathered, in paper format and then discussed with the patient / patient
proxy for validation. Amendments, where required, are annotated on the
paper copies. The Clinician then manually transcribes all appropriate
medications into the hospital Patient Administration System (PAS) /
Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system and the patient’s paper drug
chart before completing the admission / consultation Process.

## Use Case Justification

### Clinical and Administration

-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the
    opportunity for errors to occur.

-   Reduction in transcription between systems and paper to IT, leading
    to a reduction in prescribing errors.

-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting
    and collating information.

-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually
    updating IT systems.

-   Reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the systems
    workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.

### Patient Focused

-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through
    the reduction of paper-based “Patient Identifiable Documents” in use
    within departments.

-   Increased patient / clinician time due to reduction in clinician
    time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the
    patient.

-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual
    transcription errors.

-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for
    information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Cost Reduction

-   Reduction in printing supplies.

## Primary Actors

- Clinician

- PAS / EPR

- GP Connect

- GP Clinical System

## Secondary Actors

- Patient

## Triggers

- Patient is admitted to, or attends hospital for treatment

## Pre-Conditions

-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the
    hospitals PAS / EPR upon admission / attendance.

-   Hospital staff have the correct / appropriate system access rights.

-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP
    Connect.

-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed / used by
    hospital staff.

-   Electronic Interactions between Hospital System(s) / GP Connect / GP
    Clinical System have been correctly configured.

-   An Electronic Prescribing & Medicines Administration (EPMA) system
    is in use and integrates with the PAS / EPR.

## Post Conditions

-   **On Success:**

-   **Guaranteed:**

    -   A full history of medication used by the patient on admission /
        attendance:

        -   Medication prescribed by the patient’s GP.

        -   Medication prescribed in other care settings.

        -   Medication obtained elsewhere, i.e. “Over the Counter”.

    -   Patients receive the correct medications when admitted.

## Basic Flow with Alternative and Exception Flows

*{The basic flow is the best case scenario (i.e. the happy path) of what
should happen in the use case if all the conditions are met. Describe
other allowed variations of the basic flow. Are the any alternate routes
that can be taken? Describe Error Conditions or what happens when a
failure occurs in the flow}*
