summary: "Use case for community cardiac nurse"
---

## Brief description 

The community cardiac nurse provides rehabilitation and care for patients recovering from cardiac illness, heart operations, heart attacks and heart failure. This may be through clinics or home visits. The aim is to provide a breadth of support to aid recovery and prevent re-admissions to hospital.

The community care nurse needs access to a variety of information which may already be captured in health systems, such as the GP record. The community care nurse will utilise the information to populate elements of the clinical assessment. The community care nurse may also request tests and medication changes via the GP and may wish to track progress on these or view the results. The GP record may contain information to support decision making such as allergy information, social history or mental capacity. The community nurse will need to monitor certain information to see trends - for example, changes over time to a medication dosage, blood pressure results. The community care nurse will also monitor for general wellbeing to check the necessary care and support is being delivered.

Providing access to the structured data will enable the consumer system to incorporate features such as pulling data directly into the clinical assessment, displaying information alongside the clinical assessment to aid decision making and task management, pulling back specific information such as blood test result or mapping information to show trends.

## Use case justification 

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems
  - data can be formatted and filtered by the local system, so the clinician is presented the information they need in a suitable format
  - share more relevant data, pertinent to the role of the professional involved and improve care delivery

Patient-focused:

  - increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient
  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the community healthcare service

## Primary actors 

  - Community Healthcare Team
  - GP Connect
  - GP clinical systems
  - Community healthcare system

## Secondary actors 

  - patient

**Triggers 

  - patient has been referred to the Community Cardiac Service for rehabilitation for some form of heart condition

## Preconditions 

  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the community healthcare system (or created by an electronic referral)
  - the community cardiac nurse has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect
  - the patient consents to this shared information being viewed/used
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/community healthcare system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions 

  - **On success**
    
      - the community cardiac nurse plans and enacts the most appropriate care and support through the information on the patient's medical history and personal circumstances

  - **Guaranteed**
    
      - the community cardiac nurse will assess the patient's needs based on the information available

Alternative Path 3 could have equivalent flows for observations instead of medication such as to monitor blood pressure measurements over time.
