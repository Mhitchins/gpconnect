## Brief description 

The community healthcare team needs to be aware of and support the end of life plans made by a patient and their representatives. The items relating to the palliative care need to be identified at the start of providing care and monitored for changes throughout the period of care. The details within the end of life plan will influence the care to be provided and the funding of that care. The elements of the end of life plan may change over time, so it is important to be able to check them quickly for the latest information.

Utilising structured record access enables a consumer system to draw together the necessary elements of the end of life plan, enable searching for specific elements and incorporate elements of the plan into local assessments or plan templates - for example, pull information into the Electronic Palliative Care Co-ordination System (EPaCCS) template.

## Use case justification 

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems
  - data can be formatted and filtered by the local system, so the clinician is presented the information they need in a suitable format

Patient-focused:

  - increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient
  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the community healthcare service

## Primary actors 

  - Community Healthcare Team
  - GP Connect
  - GP Clinical Systems
  - Community Healthcare System/EPaCCS

## Secondary actors 

  - patient
  - next of kin/carers/PoA

## Triggers 

  - patient has been referred to a Community Healthcare Team and is subject to an End of Life plan

## Preconditions 

  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the community healthcare system (or created by an electronic referral)
  - the community healthcare nurse has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect
  - the patient consents to this shared information being viewed/used
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/community healthcare system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions 

  - **On success**
    
      - the community healthcare team provide care in keeping with the wishes of the patient in their end of life plan

  - **Guaranteed**
    
      - the community healthcare team will assess the patient needs based on the information available
