## Use Case Name

Triaged by Clinical Assessment Service clinician after referral to Single Point of Access for Mental Health.

## Brief Description

A patient is referred via Single Point of Access (SPA) and it has not
been indicated which service is required, then the referral is passed to
the Clinical Assessment Service (CAS) team to triage.

The CAS clinician triaging the referral will have full access to the
patient’s GP record to ensure that the referral is directed to the
correct Mental Health service.

## Use Case Justification

### Clinical and Administration

-   Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the
    opportunity for errors to occur.

-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting
    and collating information.

-   Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually
    updating IT systems.

-   Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by
    utilising the systems workflow to manage tasks using staff time
    efficiently.

### Patient Focused

-   Security of patient information is maintained and improved through
    the reduction of paper-based “Patient Identifiable Documents” in use
    within departments.

-   Increased patient / clinician time due to reduction in clinician
    time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the
    patient.

-   Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual
    transcription errors.

-   Better patient experience as they are not being asked for
    information which should already be available to the clinician.

## Primary Actors

- CAS Team

- PARIS System

- GP Connect

- GP Clinical System.

## Secondary Actors

- Patient

## Triggers

- Patient is referred to Mental health services using the Single Point of Access services, a service is not identified.

## Pre-Conditions

-   The patient’s details have been verified and entered on the PARIS
    system.

-   CAS staff have the correct / appropriate system access rights.

-   The patient’s GP has agreed to share patient information via GP
    Connect.

-   The patient allows this shared information to be viewed / used by GP
    staff.

-   Electronic Interactions between PARIS system / GP Connect / GP
    Clinical System have been correctly configured.

## Post Conditions

-   **On Success:**

-   **Guaranteed:**

    -   All the relevant available information on the patient’s medical
        history has been viewable on the PARIS system used by the CAS
        team to triage the referral to the correct service.

## Basic Flow with Alternative and Exception Flows

*{The basic flow is the best case scenario (i.e. the happy path) of what
should happen in the use case if all the conditions are met. Describe
other allowed variations of the basic flow. Are the any alternate routes
that can be taken? Describe Error Conditions or what happens when a
failure occurs in the flow}*
