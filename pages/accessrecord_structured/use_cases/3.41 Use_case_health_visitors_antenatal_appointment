summary: "Use case for Antenatal"

**Brief description:**

Before the first appointment for a health visitor referral the health visitor needs to collect all information about the patient in order to provide the best possible care during pregnancy. The Health Visitor seeing the patient will have full access to the patient’s GP record ensuring that the patient receives the best possible standard of care

**Use case justification:**

Clinical and Administration:
* Access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur.
* Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information.
* Reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems.
*	Reducing the paper flow through departments/organisations by utilising the systems workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently.
Patient Focused:
*	Security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based “Patient Identifiable Documents” in use within departments.
*	Increased patient / clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient.
*	Increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors.
*	Better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the clinician.


**Primary actors:**

- paramedic
- mobile EPR system

**Secondary actors:**

- patient

**Triggers:**

- attending paramedic is informed / is aware that a patient has collapsed and is unconscious (may be en route or in attendance)

**Pre-conditions:**

  - patient is registered on mobile EPR; NHS number is available
  - the mobile EPR can access the GP information
  - the paramedic has the relevant permissions to access the information
  - the patient has consented to share the information
  - DNR is recorded as one of a set of possible clinical codes in the patents medical record on the GP system

**Post conditions:**

  - **On Success:**
    
      - the patient receives the most appropriate and timely treatment

  - **Guaranteed:**
    
      - the patient receives safe treatment
      - access is recorded for auditing purposes
      - information on which decisions are made is available for critical incident review / medico-legal investigation.

**Basic flow with alternative and exception flows:**

*{The basic flow is the best case scenario (meaning the happy path) of what should happen in the use case if all the conditions are met. Describe other allowed variations of the basic flow. Are the any alternate routes that can be taken? Describe Error Conditions or what happens when a failure occurs in the flow}*
