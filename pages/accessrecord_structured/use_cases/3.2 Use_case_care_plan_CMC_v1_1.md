## Use Case Name

View GP Current Medication in Coordinate my Care.

## Brief Description

A Coordinate my Care (CMC) user views a patient’s urgent care plan and,
along with the existing care plan data, can see current medications
pulled in real time from the GP system relevant for that patient.

For the purpose of the use case, we will assume an urgent care user of
CMC, such as a paramedic working for the London Ambulance service.
However, CMC is used in emergency, primary, and secondary services, and
clinicians from all these areas also access CMC urgent care plans for
patients in Greater London.

The following list comprises of the types of urgent care users who will
utilise the information that will be:

-   Doctor in A & E Department

-   Nurse in A & E Department

-   Clinical Adviser in 111 service

-   Out of Hours (OOH) GP

-   Paramedic from Ambulance Service

Smartcard access is not required to access CMC. Many users login with a
CMC user name and password. A smartcard is one of the options they have
available to them. For EMIS practices we have implemented Single Sign On
which allows us to link the EMIS user account to the CMC account and
provides a way for them to access the application from within EMIS Web.

## Use Case Justification

This use case is focussed on patient safety: where a wide range of
clinicians who currently do not have access to patient current
medication could have this information available to them.

In Greater London, the CMC urgent care plan is accessed by urgent and
non-urgent care providers who are able to view key information,
assisting decision making in urgent and non-urgent care scenarios.
Anticipatory medication is included in the care plans but due to the
dynamic nature of current medication, ‘current medication’ is not
included in care plan data. The GP connect service would allow CMC to
pull this data in real time, ensuring the most up-to-date view of
medication on the GP system is reflected on the CMC plan safely.

CMC currently requires the user to input urgent care medications and
does not pull them from any other data source.

-   This information could be used in urgent, acute, primary and
    community settings, as CMC is used by clinicians in all these areas
    across Greater London. CMC is used by approximately: 30 Urgent care
    providers including LAS and NWL 111

    CMC is a web-based application that supports the development of an
    urgent care plan for a patient. Many users across different care
    settings collaborate on a single version of the truth for a patient.
    This application is accessed over an N3 network. The application is
    available over Non N3 using 2 factor Authentication which is made
    available to organisations on a case by case basis. Many hospices do
    not have N3 access so they would be required to comply with our mini
    IG toolkit before access is provided using this method.

    Intersystems is our technology partner and we have procured a
    solution which encompasses many of their technologies.

    The application is available through the following URL
    <https://nww.coordinatemycare.net/csp/healthshare/hscc/compat/login.html?>

    We are currently working on a rollout to extend access to users by
    enabling it to be launched from their own native system. This is
    currently in place with EMIS web and in a test environment for
    Homerton University Hospital NHS Trust.


-   1,000+ GP practices (covering TPP, EMIS, Microtest and INPS)

    Currently CMC can be launched from within EMIS web in patient
    context. The system does not update EMIS but it allows the user to
    access CMC from within a patient record using the Portal SDK
    functionality.

    The number of EMIS practices in London is in the region of 960. Over
    500 practices have completed the configuration to access CMC from
    EMIS web. We are looking to promote this to extend usage beyond GP
    Practices into Community.

-   35 Acute hospitals

    Currently CMC is access via the url shared above. There are plans to
    roll out a similar in context launch from acute systems and this has
    so far been achieved in a test environment with the Homerton who use
    Cerner Millennium.


-   20 Hospices

    Please see responses above

CMC are not reliant on SNOMED codes for this use case. We may be
interested in doing the mapping to future-proof the CMC solution.

Currently in greater London approximately 100 CMC plans are viewed per
day. At this point I don’t have figures on time-of-day, but many will be
viewed in out-of-hours scenarios. For planning purposes we should assume
that every time an urgent care plan is viewed, the medications section
will be viewed (which is likely).

It is projected annual cost of admissions related to adverse drug
reactions to the NHS is £466 million, and over 70% of these admissions
are thought to be avoidable.<sup>1</sup>

CMC offers multidisciplinary monitoring and updating of medications in
real time. This has patient safety and cost applicability to medications
such as:

-   anti-coagulations services

-   drug abuse programs

-   medications documented on CMC urgent care plan for patients at the
    end of their lives, enabling community services to administer
    medications required to keep patients comfortable in their own
    homes, thus avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions

An interoperability solution with GP systems for current medication will
also mitigate any risks associated with manual entry of current
medication to non-GP systems, including transcription errors and
information becoming out of date. This would also save time for any
clinicians who currently manually transcribe this to other systems but
who could access this information via CMC.

## Primary Actors

-   CMC Urgent care user (London Ambulance Service paramedic, OOH GP,
    111 and A&E staff)

-   CMC non urgent care user (acute hospital clinician, community nurse,
    allied health professional, social worker)

-   GPs

## Triggers

-   urgent care user accesses CMC urgent care plan and navigates to
    medication page of that patient’s plan

## Pre-Conditions

-   patient is registered to a GP in one of the 32 Greater London CCGs
    covered by CMC

-   current medications have been populated in GP system and this is
    available to GP connect

-   care plan has been created in CMC for relevant patient

-   urgent care actor is a registered cmc user and user’s organisation
    has signed isa and acceptable use policies

## Post Conditions

-   **On Success:**

    When accessing the medications page on the CMC care plan, all
    current medications available in the relevant GP system are
    presented to the user instantly, in real time.

-   **Guaranteed:**

	The request to pull data and the outcome – successful/unsuccessful with other metadata is logged and auditable.

	It is clear to the user where the call has been completed and there are no current medications captured (‘none’ or similar message is presented).

	It is clear to the user where the GP connect service is not contactable (‘GP system not available’ or similar message is presented).
