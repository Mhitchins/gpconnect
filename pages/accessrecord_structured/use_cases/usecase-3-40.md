summary: "Use case for paramedic"
---

## Brief description 

A paramedic is visiting a patient who has collapsed at home and needs to ascertain whether the patient has a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order recorded on the GP system, and the date it was recorded. Ideally, the paramedic would be able to see DNR history and associated information such as whether the patient and family are aware of the decision.

They should also be able to access an uploaded document, if it exists.

The paramedic has access to a mobile EPR system.

The flow of data will be from the GP practice clinical system to be viewed via the mobile EPR system.

Data needs to be supplied using SNOMED CT codes.

This use case will take place every time a paramedic with access to a mobile EPR system treats a patient. The expected volume of this happening is to be determined.

## Use case justification 

Although a paramedic may make an independent clinical decision about whether to resuscitate, it is best practice to check whether earlier decisions have been made. Decisions are currently recorded on paper forms which are left with the patient. In an urgent situation it is often hard to locate the document, which means that patients can receive inappropriate and undignified treatment.

## Primary actors 

- paramedic
- mobile EPR system

**Secondary actors 

- patient

**Triggers 

- attending paramedic is informed/is aware that a patient has collapsed and is unconscious (may be en route or in attendance)

## Preconditions 

  - patient is registered on mobile EPR; NHS Number is available
  - the mobile EPR can access the GP information
  - the paramedic has the relevant permissions to access the information
  - the patient has consented to share the information
  - DNR is recorded as one of a set of possible clinical codes in the patient's medical record on the GP system

## Postconditions 

  - **On Success:**
    
      - the patient receives the most appropriate and timely treatment

  - **Guaranteed:**
    
      - the patient receives safe treatment
      - access is recorded for auditing purposes
      - information on which decisions are made is available for critical incident review/medico-legal investigation
