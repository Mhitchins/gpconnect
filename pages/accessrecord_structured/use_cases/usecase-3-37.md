summary: "Use case for community pharmacist providing diabetes services"
---

## Brief description 

The community pharmacist provides a diabetes service. Providing this service to patients can reduce the workload on the local GP Practice(s) so the Practice(s) can focus on higher priority or more critical services or provide greater convenience to the patient and thus the local GP Practice(s) refer patients to the community pharmacist.

## Use case justification 

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - data can be formatted and filtered by the local system, so the clinician is presented the information they need in a suitable format
  - reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information

Patient-focused:

  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - optimise the sign-posting of patients to the most appropriate endpoint taking into consideration patient-specific healthcare history and current concerns
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the GP

## Primary actors 

  - GP
  - community pharmacist
  - GP Connect
  - community pharmacy IT system
  - GP clinical systems

## Secondary actors 

  - patient

## Triggers 

  - the patient attends a diabetes service at a community pharmacy

## Preconditions 

  - the patient has been referred to the diabetes service from their GP/primary care service
  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the community pharmacy IT system
  - the community pharmacist has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP (practice/federation) has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect with the community pharmacy
  - the patient consents to this shared information being viewed/used
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/community pharmacy IT system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions 

  - **On success**
    
      - the information provided by GP Connect is used to inform the community pharmacist of all the patient's relevant medical history such that the community pharmacist can provide the best possible advice regarding the patient's condition

  - **Guaranteed**
    
      - the patient is appropriately assessed according to the test results and any information the patient provides
