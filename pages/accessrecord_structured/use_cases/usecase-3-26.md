summary: "Use case for mental health new referral daily triage"
---

## Brief description

The mental health service holds a daily triage where the team comes together to review new referrals. The main (but not sole) source of referrals is from GPs. Currently the referrals are unstructured (paper based). The format of these referrals is inconsistent. The extent and quality of information varies significantly. Whilst some will be concise and informative, others will lack key information which it is likely the GP record holds, and others will contain extensive detail making the most salient points difficult to access quickly. The triage team are in the process of defining a “minimum dataset” they wish to request for the referral details.

It is thought that the referral process could be improved if the referral information could be captured in the GP systems in accordance with the minimum dataset and transmitting to the mental health service system in a structured format.

## Use case justification

Clinical and administration:

  - access to accurate information at the point of care reducing the opportunity for errors to occur
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, collecting and collating information
  - reduction in clinical time wasted, away from the patient, manually updating IT systems
  - reducing the paper flow through departments by utilising the system workflow to manage tasks using staff time efficiently

Patient-focused:

  - security of patient information is maintained and improved through the reduction of paper-based 'patient identifiable documents' in use within departments
  - increased patient/clinician time due to reduction in clinician time spent collecting and transcribing information away from the patient
  - increased patient safety due to the reduction in manual transcription errors
  - better patient experience as they are not being asked for information which should already be available to the mental health service

## Primary actors

  - Mental Health Triage Team (Mental Health Practitioner, Clinical Psychologist, etc.)
  - GP Connect
  - GP clinical systems
  - Mental Health Service system (PARIS)

## Secondary actors

  - patient

**Triggers

  - GP has referred a patient to the community mental health service

## Preconditions

  - the patient's details have been verified and entered on the community mental health system (or created by an electronic referral)
  - the mental health practitioner has the correct/appropriate system access rights
  - the patient's GP has agreed to share patient information via GP Connect
  - the patient consents to this shared information being viewed/used
  - electronic interactions between GP clinical system/GP Connect/community mental health system have been correctly configured

## Postconditions

  - **On success**
    
      - the patient's referral details are made available to the triage team in a concise manner

  - **Guaranteed**
    
      - the triage team will assess the patient needs based on the information available
