## Use case ##

This API is used to amend the `description` or `comment` fields of a patient's future appointment, obtained via either the [Retrieve a patient's appointments](appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html), or [Read an appointment](appointments_use_case_read_an_appointment.html) APIs.  Any appointment irrespective of booking organisation can be amended by a consuming organisation participating with the appointment hosting organisation in a GP Connect deployment.

The typical flow to amend an appointment is:

 1. Search by NHS number for, or otherwise obtain, a `Patient` resource.
 2. Search for `Appointment` resources for the `Patient` resource.
 3. Choose an `Appointment` resource and update `description` and/or `comment` fields.

Amending a cancelled appointment is NOT supported.

{% include important.html content="The Appointment Management capability pack is aimed at administration of a patient's appointments. As a result of information governance (IG) requirements, the amend appointments capability has been restricted to future appointments. More details are available on the [Design decisions](appointments_design.html#viewing-and-amending-booked-appointments) page." %}

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details 

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service
- SHALL have previously found the appointment ID using [Retrieve a patient's appointments](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html)

## API usage ##

The consumer system SHALL only use the amend appointment capability to amend:

  - `description` or `comment` fields.  Providers SHALL return an error when any other field is amended.
  - future appointments where appointment start date/time is after the current date/time. If the appointment start date/time is in the past the provider SHALL return an error.
  - appointments that have not been cancelled.  Providers SHALL return an error where an amendment to a cancelled appointment is received.

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
PUT /Appointment/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
PUT https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Appointment/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:update:appointment-1` |
| `If-Match`           | The Appointment's current [ETag](development_general_api_guidance.html#managing-resource-contention), e.g. `W/"23"` |

#### Payload request body ####

The request payload is a profiled version of the standard FHIR [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/appointment.html) resource. See [FHIR resources](/datalibraryappointment.html) page for more detail.

Consumer systems:
- SHALL send an `Appointment` resource that conforms to the [GPConnect-Appointment-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-Appointment-1) profile.
- SHALL include the URI of the `GPConnect-Appointment-1` profile StructureDefinition in the `Appointment.meta.profile` element of the appointment resource.
- SHALL NOT amend an appointment with a status of `cancelled`

  {% include important.html content="It is recommended that Consumers read the Appointment they wish to amend (via Read an appointment or Retrieve a patient's appointments), then update the fields allowed below in place. Attempting to recreate the Appointment resource from local transformed data formats/structures is not advised, and may result in the provider system rejecting the amendment due to an unintended change or missing field." %}

Only the following data-elements can be modified when performing an appointment amendment:
- `description`
- `comment`


  {% include note.html content="For providers who only support the mandatory `description` element and not the `comment` element. If a `comment` is received as part of the amendment the provider SHOULD append the content of the comment to the description within the appointment so that the additional information is not lost." %}

To reduce the risk of information being truncated when stored on the providers side, consumers SHALL impose:
- a 100 character limit on the appointment `description` element when editing a GP Connect appointment.
- a 500 character limit on the appointment `comment` element when editing a GP Connect appointment.

On the wire a JSON serialised request would look something like the following:

}
```

#### Error handling ####

The provider system:

- SHALL return an [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.
- SHALL return an error where:
  - any appointment details other than the appointment `comment` or `description` are amended. The appointment resource should be considered invalid and the provider system should return a `422` error with error code `INVALID_RESOURCE`.
  - the appointment being amended is in the past (the appointment start dateTime is before the current date and time).
  - the appointment has been cancelled.  Provider systems should return a `422` error with error code `INVALID_RESOURCE`.
  - the version identifier in the `If-Match` header does not match the Appointment's current version identifier.  See [Managing resource contention](development_general_api_guidance.html#managing-resource-contention).

Refer to [Development - FHIR API guidance - error handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.
