summary: "Requirements for Provider System End-User to be able to configure what slots are available to GP Connect Booking Organisation Consumers"
---

Given the increasing requirement for cross-organisational appointment access, there is a requirement to better ensure that the right appointment slots are made available to the right external organisations via
  - enhancing the ability of Provider Organisations to control appointment availability and booking to, and by, external organisations
  - ensuring that Consumer organisations obtain only appointment availability appropriate for them

To meet these requirements, Provider systems SHALL, in addition to enabling end-users to designate Schedules and Slots within their Appointment books as 'GP Connect bookable', provide the following additional functionality:
  - enable end-users to specify which appointments can be booked by 
    -- individual and/or 
    -- groups of external organisations and/or
  -- booking organisation type
  - limit the number of slots which can be booked by an external organisation type or organisation(s)
  
It is recommended that Provider systems also provide the functionality
  - control how far in advance external organisations should be allowed to book slots and how near to the actual slot time   -  this requirement to be optional
