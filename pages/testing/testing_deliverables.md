## Provider testing (SIT) ##

An automated provider test harness has been made publically available to allow standardised testing of the FHIR APIs prior to any formal assurance activities being undertaken. This approach aims to streamline the end-to-end assurance process by ensuring that a common baseline level of technical conformance has been achieved, an thus fewer issues are surfaced during formal assurance.

### Provider testing layers ###

| Category | Layer  | Details  |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Provider capability      | API orchestration | Use cases |
| Provider terminology     | API data layer    | Test cases |
| Technical      | API payload(s)    | FHIR profile conformance, valueset usage, constraint rules   |
| Technical      | API conformance   | URL format, URL parameters, HTTP error handling |
| Standards      | FHIR DSTU2 conformance  | metadata, RESTful, identifier handling, search patterns |
| Technical      | Spine integration | SSL certificate handling, URL format, SSP headers |
| Standards      | HTTP conformance  | accept encodings, transfer encodings, ETags compression |
| Standards      | JWT conformance  | authentication, claims, auditing |
| Standards      | SSL conformance  | TLS versions, supported ciphers, client authentication, certificate revocation |

## Consumer testing (SIT) ##

### Consumer testing layers ###

An additional UI testing layer is required for consumer systems.

|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Consumer capability | UI behaviours | UI use case automation |

### Non functional ###

| Category       | Layer               | Details          |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Security       | Penetration testing | OSWASP top 10    |
