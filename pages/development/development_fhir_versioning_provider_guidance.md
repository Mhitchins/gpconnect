Provider systems are required to publish a Service Root URL in the Spine Directory Service in the following format:

{% include callout.html content="`https://[FQDN of FHIR Server]/[ODS Code]/[FHIR_VERSION_NAME]/{PROVIDER_MAJOR_VERSION}`" %}

- `[FQDN of FHIR Server]` is the fully qualified domain name where traffic will be routed to the logical FHIR server for the organisation in question

- `[ODS Code]` is the [Organisation Data Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/organisation-data-service) code which uniquely identifies the GP Practice organisation

- `[FHIR_VERSION_NAME]` refers to the textual name identifying the major FHIR version, examples being `DSTU2` and `STU3`. The FHIR Version name SHALL be specified in UPPERCASE characters.

- `{PROVIDER_VERSION}` identifies the version of the provider API. The version is required in the url to aid with error investigation if problems occur when a consumers tries to call a providers endpoint.
  
- The FHIR Base URL SHALL NOT contain a trailing `/`


#### Example Server Root URL ####
