GP Connect has specified profiled versions of the international [Fhir Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/){:target="_blank"}, tailoring them to meet the requirements of the GP Connect use cases and to aid in interoperability between systems.

The profiled FHIR&reg; resources required for each of the GP Connect capability packs are specified within the specific specification sections for each of the capabilities:

* [Foundations](datalibraryfoundation.html)
* [Access Record HTML](datalibraryaccessRecord.html)
* [Access Record Structured](accessrecord_rest.html)
* [Appointment Management](appointments.html)
