| ODS Code | Organisation | `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code` |
| ODS Site Code | Location | `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-site-code` |
| SDS User ID | Practitioner | `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-user-id` |

## Definition of Organisation and Location entities

The GP practice organisation is a legal entities which is represented by the FHIR `Organization` resource. This entity will have an assigned [ODS code](https://digital.nhs.uk/organisation-data-service). 

The practice organisation will have one or more operating locations (a.k.a. sites or branches) which together perform the patient healthcare for which the organisation is legally responsible. Each operating location is represented by a FHIR `Location` resource. 

Where ODS Site codes are defined in SPINE configuration, these map to GP practice operating locations, and hence to Location FHIR resources.
