## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint Base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- MAY have previously [resolved the logical ID of the organisation](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/foundations_use_case_find_an_organisation.html) from the ODS Organisation Code.

## API use case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background please see the [Foundations Capability Bundle](foundations.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit & provenance details. 

## API usage ##

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
GET /Organization/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Organization/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:organization-1`|

#### Payload request body ####

N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

For example, the:

- Logical identifier of the resource is not valid/can't be found on the server.  

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
- SHALL return `Organization` resources that conform to the [CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1) profile.

- SHALL populate the following `Organization` fields:
  - `meta.profile` with the profile URI
  - `versionId` with the current version of the `Organization` resource.
  - `identifier` with relevent business identifiers (i.e. ODS code) for each `Organization` resource.
  - `name`
  - `address` where available
  - `telecom` where available

- SHALL meet [General FHIR resource population requirements](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#general-fhir-resource-population-requirements) populating all fields where data is available, excluding those listed below
