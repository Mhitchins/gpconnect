## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service
- SHALL have previously [resolved the logical ID of the patient](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/foundations_use_case_find_a_patient.html) on the server using the NHS number

## API use case ##

This specification describes a single use cases. For complete details and background, please see the [Foundations Capability Bundle](foundations.html).

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## API usage ##

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
GET /Patient/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
GET https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Patient/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:patient-1`|

#### Payload request body ####

N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems SHALL return a [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

For example, the:

- logical identifier of the resource is not valid/can't be found on the server 

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
- SHALL return `Patient` resources that conform to the [CareConnect-GPC-Patient-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Patient-1) profile.

- SHALL populate the following fields:
  - `meta.profile` with the profile URI
  - `versionId` with the current version of the `Patient` resource.
  - `identifier` with relevant business identifiers, including a minimum of the patient's NHS number
  - `name`
    - The patient resource SHALL contain a single instance of the name element with the `use` of `official` and SHALL contain the name synchronised with PDS.
  - `birthDate`
  - `gender`
  - `address` where available
  - `telecom` where available
  - `contact` with the patient's contacts - see [Patient.contact population](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#patientcontact) for further details
  - `registrationDetails.preferredBranchSurgery` with a reference to a `Location` resource representing the patient's preferred branch surgery (see [Branch surgeries](development_branch_surgeries.html) for more details)
  - `nhsCommunication` with the patient's language information, where available
  - `managingOrganization` Note: this is the current organisation, as addressed by ODS code in the base URL, and NOT the patient's registered practice which may be different
  
- SHALL meet [General FHIR resource population requirements](development_fhir_resource_guidance.html#general-fhir-resource-population-requirements) populating all fields where data is available, excluding those listed below

- SHALL NOT populate the following fields:
  - `ethnicCategory`
  - `religiousAffiliation`
  - `patient-cadavericDonor`
  - `residentialStatus`
  - `treatmentCategory`
  - `birthPlace`
  - `maritalStatus`
  - `multipleBirthBoolean`
