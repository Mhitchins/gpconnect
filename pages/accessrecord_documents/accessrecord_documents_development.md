## Introduction ##

The access record structured capability provides the ability to retrieve data from a patient's GP record in a structured and coded format. In order to do this safely and effectively, we need to consider how GP systems store data about patients, how it is categorised/structured and how the context in which the data is entered by or displayed to the user may influence its meaning.
