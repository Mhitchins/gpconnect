## Use case ##

Retrieve a patient's documents from a GP practice.

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- **MUST** have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- **MUST** have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service

#### Request headers ####

Consumers **MUST** include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's Trace ID (a GUID or UUID) |

#### Payload request body ####
N/A

#### Error handling ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a [`GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1`](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more data fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

Examples of other scenarios which may result in error being returned:

- Where a logical identifier of the resource is not valid/can’t be found on the server, a 404 HTTP Status code would be returned with the relevant OperationOutcome resource.

Refer to [Development - FHIR API Guidance - Error Handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.

### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####
Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR® standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems **MUST**:

- return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code to indicate successful execution of the operation.
- return a `Binary` resource conforming to the [`Binary`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/binary.html) resource definition
-
- include the `versionId` of the current version of the `Binary` resource.
