GP Connect is a service that can allow authorised clinical staff in GP practices and other care settings to share GP practice clinical information and data between IT systems, quickly and efficiently. This ensures patient medical information is available to clinicians when and where they need it, improving patient care.

<p>GP Connect is developing standardised {% include tooltip.html type="API" %} specifications to be used by any system for the sharing of data, so that clinicians in different care settings can:</p>

* view a patient’s GP practice record
* import or download medication and allergies information from this record 
*	manage a patient's GP appointments

This will provide better, safer, more convenient care for patients and save time for clinicians. It will also help meet targets under [NHS England’s improving access to general practice programme](https://www.england.nhs.uk/gp/gpfv/redesign/improving-access/).

## GP Connect APIs and capabilities ##
The APIs are grouped into sets, known as 'capabilities', which enable specific business functionality. GP Connect has worked with GP clinical system suppliers to deliver the following capabilities:

*	Access Record HTML – enables clinicians to view a patient’s medical record
*	Appointment Management – enables clinical staff to book, amend or cancel an appointment for a patient
*	Access Record Structured – enables an export of a patient’s medications and allergies

## Pilot using the GP Connect APIs ##
The GP Connect programme is now supporting the development of systems that connect with the APIs to use data from patient records and appointment schedulers for patient care by integrating it or importing it into local clinical systems.

We’re working with selected partnerships of health and care organisations and software suppliers. Partnerships will use the APIs to develop technical solutions to local issues with sharing patient records and appointment booking across system boundaries.
We’ve developed a process called ‘First of Type’ to support this development and provide assurance for these early products.
