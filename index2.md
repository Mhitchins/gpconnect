<p>GP Connect is developing standardised {% include tooltip.html type="API" %} specifications to support the development of products that allow GP practices and authorised staff to share clinical information and data between IT systems. The APIs are grouped into sets, known as '[capabilities](/overview_priority_capabilities.html)', which enable clinicians in different care settings to:</p>  

* view a patient’s GP practice record - with [Access Record HTML](/accessrecord.html)
*	manage a patient's GP appointments - with [Appointment Management](/appointments.html)
* import or download medication and allergies information - with [Access Record Structured](/accessrecord_structured/accessrecord_structured.html) 

## Using this specification ##

This specification has been created to support the adoption of GP Connect APIs and FHIR&reg; resources. As such, the site is structured around GP Connect stakeholders including API users, developers and architects.

The above steps outline the complete development journey for developing products using GP Connect APIs.

## Pilot using the GP Connect APIs ##
The GP Connect programme is now supporting the development of systems that connect with the APIs to use data from patient records and appointment schedulers for patient care by integrating it or importing it into local clinical systems.

We’re working with selected partnerships of health and care organisations and software suppliers. Partnerships will use the APIs to develop technical solutions to local issues with sharing patient records and appointment booking across system boundaries.
We’ve developed a process called ‘First of Type’ to support this development and provide assurance for these early products.
